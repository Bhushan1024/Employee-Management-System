# Employee Management System

When building a full stack project using Spring for the backend and React for the frontend, I combined the strengths of both technologies to create a robust and responsive web application.

**Project Description:** 
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a full stack web application designed to streamline and optimize the management of employee-related tasks within an organization. Leveraging the powerful combination of Spring for the backend and React for the frontend, the system ensures robust functionality and a user-friendly interface.

**Technologies Used:**

**Backend (SpringBoot):**

1.Spring Boot Framework:
The backend is built using the Spring Boot framework, which facilitates the development of robust and scalable Java-based applications.

2.RESTful API:
The application exposes RESTful APIs to handle various operations related to employee management, such as creating, updating, and deleting employee records.

3.Data Persistence (Database):
The system uses a relational database MySQL to store employee data. Hibernate is employed as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the database.


**Frontend (React):**

1.React Components:
Create React components to build the user interface. Components can represent various parts of the employee management system, such as employee lists, forms for data input, and dashboards.

2.React Router:
Use React Router for client-side routing. This enables navigation within the React application without triggering full-page reloads.

3.Axios or Fetch API:
Axios or the Fetch API is used to make HTTP requests from the React frontend to interact with the RESTful API endpoints on the backend.

**Project Goals:**

The Employee Management System (EMS) project aims to centralize and optimize employee data management using a full stack approach with Spring and React. Key goals include implementing  providing a responsive user interface, enabling efficient CRUD operations , enhancing overall system scalability and performance. The project prioritizes user-friendly features and seamless cross-platform compatibility to streamline HR processes and improve organizational efficiency.

**API testing:** Employee Management System includes RESTful APIs, API testing tools like Postman. Link for Project on Postman-https://www.postman.com/bhushan1024/workspace/projects/collection/29683481-128316c1-10ce-4156-a690-6ebbb81694f8?action=share&creator=29683481
